# Creating Tables

My first challenge came after creating all the tables when I forgot to create Primary and Foreign keys.  The ERD I created was wrong regarding the relationships to other tables.

Once I figured out the correct ERD I started to create tables again but didn't take into consideration the order of creation so I had errors.  After creating them in the correct order I had an error with my last table dept_emp because there was no unique value to assign as a PK so I created a composite key.
